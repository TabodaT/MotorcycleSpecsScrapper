x	- DELETE
x		- delete using url
v	- don't insert new models if there are errors

v	- fix adding end year
v	- create a list of manuf to ignore

v	- create a map to ignore when marking erroneous
v	- delete list of manuf to ignore
v	- add more ways to find capacity (start of string or in model name)
v	- fix mapping torque
v	- table24 not found are not working links?
v	- insert all with table24 missing - and mark them with "TABLE_24" in engine
v	- insert all with with no  - and mark them with "NO_FIELDS" in engine
v	- adapt ModelDetailsService.getModelDetails to look inside other tables because "table24" does not apply everywhere
v	- fix mapping speed: mph
v	- why no Avinton / Wakan?
v	- fix not inserted /model/ links
v	- set production years to "1111" to all models without production years 
v	- create a MODEL_LINKS_TO_INGNORE_LIST for pages that don't work
v	- 1/76: Blast (2007-09) https://www.motorcyclespecs.co.za/model/buell/buell_blast%2007.htm Some error while getting models details Buell / EBR java.nio.file.InvalidPathException: Trailin
v	- erase all blank pages
	- fix all inserted with no EXCEPTION table in engine, and with capacity 0
		- all that contain in spec field either "battery" or "charging" should be marked as "ELECTRIC" in engine and '-1' in capacity
		- if capacity == 0 and number >= 99 -> set as capacity
		- search in model txt (<p> elements): 'XXcc ' and extract number
		- count(*) where capacity = 0 == 1255
	- add in MODEL_LINKS_TO_INGNORE_LIST all links with errors
	- fix moto with year > 9999
	- handle ignoreURLs list
